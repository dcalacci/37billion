      "The dataset we were given included a walksheds file that represented the areas that were walkable around public transit hubs, but I wanted to be able to do a more fine-grained analysis. \n",

      "I knew I could search for a local public transit station given a latitude & longitude, but first, I needed to get the latitude and longitude from the grid cells.\n",
